# Quick GitHub Push Guide

## Option 1: Use Replit's Built-in GitHub Integration (Easiest)

1. **In Replit**, look for the "Version Control" tab in the left sidebar (git icon)
2. Click "Connect to GitHub" if not already connected
3. Click "Create Repository" or "Push to GitHub"
4. Repository name: `catalyst-center-temperature-monitor`
5. Set visibility (Public/Private)
6. Click "Create & Push"

## Option 2: Manual GitHub Push

If the built-in integration doesn't work, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) → New Repository
2. Name: `catalyst-center-temperature-monitor`
3. Description: `Cisco Catalyst Center Temperature Monitoring Dashboard`
4. Don't initialize with README (we have files already)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Get Your Repository URL
GitHub will show: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/catalyst-center-temperature-monitor.git`

### Step 3: Push from Replit Shell
Open a new Shell tab in Replit and run these commands one by one:

```bash
# Remove git locks if they exist
rm -f .git/index.lock .git/config.lock

# Set git user (replace with your details)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your-email@gmail.com"

# Add all new files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Complete Catalyst Center Temperature Monitor - Ready for Customer Deployment"

# Add your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/catalyst-center-temperature-monitor.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

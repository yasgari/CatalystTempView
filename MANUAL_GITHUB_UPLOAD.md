# Manual GitHub Upload Guide

Since the automatic push is having authentication issues, here's the easiest way to get your project on GitHub:

## Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

### Step 1: Download Files from Replit
1. **In Replit**, select these key files and download them:
   - `README.md`
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`  
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `.env.example`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`
   - All folders: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`
   - `components.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/yasgari/CatalystTempView`
2. Click **"uploading an existing file"** or **"Add file" → "Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop** all the downloaded files and folders
4. **Commit message**: `Complete Catalyst Center Temperature Monitor - Ready for Deployment`
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

## Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop (If you have it installed)
1. Download **GitHub Desktop** application
2. **Clone** your repository: `https://github.com/yasgari/CatalystTempView`
3. **Copy** all files from Replit to the local folder
4. **Commit** and **Push** through GitHub Desktop interface

## Option 3: Command Line with Personal Access Token
If you want to use command line:

1. **Create Personal Access Token** on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with "repo" permissions
   
2. **Use token instead of password**:
```bash
git remote add origin https://yasgari:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/yasgari/CatalystTempView.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What Your Customers Will Get:

Once uploaded, your repository will contain:
- ✅ **Professional Dashboard** - React temperature monitoring interface

## Repository URL:
